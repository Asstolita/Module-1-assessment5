	<H4>The very skies tremble in his presence. He commands the mystical hammer Mjolnir to protect Asgard and Earth. He is the son of Odin, Prince of Asgard. He is the God of Thunder. He is Thor.</H4>

<H2>The God of Thunder</H2>
<P>Thor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, and the Warriors Three.</P>

<P>Throughout his youth, Thor tested his limits on dangerous missions and became worthy of the Uru hammer Mjolnir, using it to save Sif from the Death Goddess Hela. While the hammer wields destructive powers, it also has the power to build and Thor also uses it to consecrate treaties and bless weddings.</P>

<P>In Thor's coming of age, he fell through a portal and battled the demigod Hercules. Equal in strength, they fought until Zeus halted their encounter, sending Thor back to Asgard and wiping the memories of both warriors. During the 9th Century, Thor spent time on Earth, leading Vikings into battle. It was not until Thor's loyal Vikings attacked a Christian monastery that he turned his back on his followers, leaving Earth and spending centuries in Asgard.</P>

<P>During his time in Asgard, Odin casted Thor into the mortal guise of Siegmund to retrieve the Rhinegold Ring from the dragon Fafnir. When Siegmund took away another's wife, Frigga compelled Odin to kill Thor, but Thor survived as Siegmund's son Siegfried. Odin succeeded at obtaining the Rhinegold Ring from Siegfried, then restored Thor to life without any memories of his former identities.</P>

<P>When Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants, Odin banished him to Earth as a lesson in humility in the form of Dr. Donald Blake. As a human, he had a limp and worked as a physician. When he was compelled by Odin to go to Norway, he came upon extraterrestrials known as the Kronans and fled into a cave. There, he found a gnarled cane and used it to try and escape; he struck it against a rock, and it became Mjolnir. The mallet then restored his memories and returned him to his former glory as the mighty God of Thunder.</P>


<P>When Loki became a menace and deceived his brother Thor on Earth, Thor saw through his lies and banded together with Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and Wasp to found the Avengers. Alongside the Avengers, Thor is a leader, master hand-to-hand combatant, and talented swordsman.</P>

<h2>Worthy Warrior and Weaponry</h2>

<p>Thor, son of Gods, has enhanced longevity, augmented by the Golden Apples of Idunn. He also possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability and immunity to most diseases.</p>

<p>Thor's greatest weapon, and closest ally, is Mjolnir, an enchanted hammer forged from Uru metal, which has power over storms and can generate energy blasts known as anti-force. Thor uses this hammer to summon rain, wind, lightning, and thunder, though he has also been known to produce lightning from his hands. While Mjolnir can manipulate weather patterns, it extends godhood and many other abilities to its commander. When spun, the mallet can allow Thor to fly, hover, and even open portals to other dimensions and realms. When thrown, it acts as a sort of boomerang, destroying all things or beings in its path before returning to its owner.</p>

<p>When Thor became unworthy of holding Mjolnir, he used Jarnbjorn, a deadly war ax.</p>

<h4>Enemies of the God</h4>
<p>Those Who Sit Above in Shadow are a consortium of wicked Gods that feed off the energies resulting from Asgard's repeated destruction, which is known as Ragnarok or "The Twilight of the Gods." The consortium recreates Asgard after each Ragnarok, resulting in an endless loop of creation, destruction, and rebirth.</p>

<p>Hela, the Goddess of Death, is Thor's niece, best known for stealing mortal souls. Once time Thor faces her, she scars him across his face. She also punishes him for releasing her souls and curses him so that he could not heal his injuries, but also not die.</p>

<p>Thor saving the innocent from Hela
Loki, an Asgardian menace, forever seeks to sow chaos out of his jealousy towards his adopted brother Thor. Whether he is trying to steal the Golden Apples of Idunn or posing as Odin, he's rarely an ally.</p>

<p>The Celestials are the omnipotent judges of all the Gods, are limitless in their power, and often serve as foils to the Asgardian royalty.</p>

<p>Karnilla, the Norn Queen and ancestral Asgardian enemy, possesses powerful mystic talismans called Norn Stones. These stones are semi-sentient and are known to refuse the commands of unworthy holders, just as Mjolnir does so. She has used these many times in her battles with the God of Thunder.</p>

<p>The Ennead Egyptian/Heliopolitan Death God Seth wages war on the Asgardians and captures Odin, imprisoning him in his Black Pyramid. Once Thor rescues Odin, and Odin bests Seth in Asgard.</p>

<p>Surtur, a fire demon, attacks Asgard so that he might claim the eternal flame and complete the forging of his sword Twilight. He proves to be a menace time and time again for Asgard and Earth, eternally stuck in a battle with Odin. The Sons of Muspel also serve Surtur against the realm.</p>

<p>Absorbing Man, Amora the Enchantress, Skurge the Executioner, Ego the Living Planet, Demon Lord Mephisto, Mangog, and Malekith the Accursed, the Dark Elf from Svartalfheim are also known foes to Thor.</p>

<h2>Allies, Friends, Family</h2>
<p>Thor's allies include Odin Borson, his father and King of the Asgardians; his mother and Earth Goddess Gaea; and his stepmother Frigga. His best friends include Sif (whom he has intermittent romances with), Balder, and the Warriors Three: Fandral the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and Volstagg the Enormous.<p>

<p>The God Heimdall is the guardian of Asgard. He protects the Asgardian borders and the Bifrost, and is forever an ally to Thor.

<p>On Earth, Thor bands together with Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to found the Avengers. Later, when the Hulk leaves, Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, joins the fold and becomes close friends with the God.</p>

<h2>First gathering of the Avengers</h2>
<p>Beta Ray Bill, a warrior alien, bests Thor in battle one time. As a reward for his strength, Odin creates a new hammer known as Stormbreaker for Bill. Bill subsequently fights alongside Thor, the Avengers, and Fantastic Four during an engagement on Earth in battle with Surtur.</p>

<p>Eric Masterson, an acquaintance of one of Thor's secret identities, Sigurd Jarlson, becomes bonded to Thor and acts a guise for him. He, occasionally, gains control of their shared body, and even takes on the codename Thunderstrike.</p>

<p>Jane Foster, a human nurse that Donald Blake falls in love with, often finds herself wrapped up in Thor's orbit, whether romantically or as an ally. She also proves to be worthy of Mjolnir and even takes on the mantle of Thor.</P>
